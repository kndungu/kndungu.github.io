Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity.

## What Makes Jekyll Special?

Jekyll takes your content written in Markdown, applies layouts, and generates a complete, static website ready to be served. This means:

- **No database required** - Everything is file-based
- **Fast and secure** - Static HTML is lightning quick and has no server-side vulnerabilities
- **Version controlled** - Your entire site lives in Git
- **Free hosting** - GitHub Pages provides free hosting for Jekyll sites

## Basic Structure

A typical Jekyll site has the following structure:

```
_posts/      # Your blog posts
_layouts/    # HTML templates
_includes/   # Reusable components
_config.yml  # Site configuration
assets/      # CSS, JS, images
```

## Writing Posts

Posts are written in Markdown and stored in the `_posts` directory. Each post needs front matter at the top:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
---
```

That's it! Jekyll handles the rest.

## Why Choose Jekyll?

1. **Simplicity** - No complicated admin interfaces
2. **Speed** - Static files serve instantly
3. **Flexibility** - Customize everything with Liquid templates
4. **Control** - You own your content and infrastructure
5. **Community** - Large ecosystem of themes and plugins

Jekyll transforms text into websites, and it does it beautifully.
