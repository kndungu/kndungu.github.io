title: "Welcome to My Blog"

Welcome to my blog! This is a special kind of blog where transparency and history matter.

## What Makes This Blog Different?

Every single blog post on this site is **version-controlled using Git**. That means:

- You can see exactly when I published or updated each post
- You can view the complete history of edits and revisions
- You can see what changed and why (through commit messages)
- Nothing is hidden or deleted—it's all in the history

## How It Works

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Here's the workflow:

1. I write blog posts in Markdown
2. I commit them to the `main` branch
3. GitHub automatically builds and publishes the site
4. You see the latest content at [kndungu.github.io](https://kndungu.github.io)

Every post has a "View History" button at the bottom that shows all the changes made to that specific post over time.

## Interactive Version Viewer

One of the coolest features of this blog is the **built-in version viewer**. For every post, you can:

- Browse through all previous versions
- See exactly what changed between any two versions
- View color-coded diffs (additions in green, deletions in red)
- Read the commit messages explaining why changes were made

Try clicking "View Past Versions & Diffs" on any post to explore this feature!

## Why Version Control for Blogging?

As ideas evolve, so should the content. Traditional blogs hide their edit history, but I believe in **transparent knowledge sharing**:

- **Accountability**: I stand by my words, and you can hold me to them
- **Evolution**: Watch how thoughts develop and mature over time
- **Learning**: See mistakes, corrections, and improvements
- **Trust**: No silent edits or hidden changes
- **Context**: Understand the reasoning behind changes through commit messages
- **Collaboration**: Others can suggest improvements via pull requests

This approach treats blog content like software - constantly improving, openly developed, and fully documented.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Technology and software development
- Tutorials and how-to guides
- Personal projects and experiments
- Thoughts on software engineering practices
- And whatever else seems interesting!

## Try It Yourself

This entire setup is open source. You can:

1. View the [repository source code](https://github.com/kndungu/kndungu.github.io)
2. See how this blog is structured
3. Fork it and create your own version-controlled blog
4. Suggest improvements via pull requests

Check out the README and ARCHITECTURE.md files in the repository for a complete guide on setting up your own blog like this.
